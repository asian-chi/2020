    title: Water Flow Visualization for Swimming using Nanocellulose
    abstract: "Fluid measurement has many significant applications in scientific and engineering research, such as evaluation of fluid simulation, design of underwater vehicles, and development of artificial hearts and engines. Fluid measurement is also an active research area in the biomechanics of water sports. In this research, we propose a potential fluid-measurement technology using nanocellulose and a harmless light source. This technology has significant contributions to biomechanics research using fluid simulation and motion analysis by providing a way to evaluate the simulation results. In this resaerch, we investigated the feasibility of the polarization-based water flow measurement technology using tracer particles with optical anisotropy.
    We measured water flow in a swimming environment with a swimmer."

    title: Gaze-based Command Activation Technique using Two-level Stroke
    abstract: "We show a gaze-based command activation technique which uses a two-level stroke as a gesture. A two-level stroke is a simple gesture such as a horizontal then a vertical stroke or a vertical then a horizontal stroke. An object on which users want to activate a command is selected with dwell-based target selection. Thus, the command is activated by dwelling on an object and then moving the gaze to form a two-level stroke. As a result of an experiment, the success rate of command activation is 85.8% and the time taken for a command activation is 956 ms."

    title: Grip Strength Rehabilitation Using a Monocular Camera
    abstract: "Hand rehabilitation recovers hand function. Grip strength exercise is one method of rehabilitation. While easy to perform, there are several problems, such as not obtaining objective feedback. Therefore, in this study, we propose a real-time measurement system for grip strength using a softball and a monocular camera. Experimental results showed the correlation between the finger joint angles estimated by an image and the air pressure of the ball when grasped and that we can estimate the grip strength from the image."

    title: Preliminary Investigation of Tapping Force on Pressure-Sensitive Touchscreen for Expanding Input Vocabulary on Smartphone
    abstract: "We propose the method to expand the input vocabulary of a smartphone using tapping force on the pressure-sensitive touchscreen. In our method, the input mode is switched by users controlling multiple levels of the tapping force. To design our method, we conducted the user study to determine the optimal number of levels and these thresholds. For example, we need to determine the thresholds between first and second, second and third levels of the tapping force in 3 levels. The results showed that users may control 3 levels of the tapping force. On the other hand, the results also showed that we need to consider the user calibration to determine the threshold instead of the fixed threshold."

    title: Expanding Input Vocabulary Using Index Finger on and Above Back of Smartphone
    abstract: "This paper presents a method to expand input vocabulary for smartphones. To this end, our method uses index finger gestures on and above the back of the smartphone. The input vocabulary of our method is according to index finger gestures such as touching and bending/stretching. To enable the detection of these gestures, we built a system composed of the smartphone and ring-like device. In pilot studies using our system, the touching the BoD was detected with an accuracy of 94.3% on average."

    title: A Self-Sensing Technique Using Inductively-Coupled Coils for Deformable User Interfaces
    abstract: "We present a device shape sensing method using coils that are inductively coupled in the horizontal direction. By observing the change in the coupling characteristics between the coils arranged side by side, the positional relationship between the coils can be detected. By using the proposed technique, the shape of an object having a coil can be sensed without an external sensing mechanism such as a camera. In this paper, we show two types of prototypes, a rigid device combining multiple small tiles and a flexible device, and verify the basic characteristics. By utilizing the proposed technique, a deformable user interface with various inputs can be constructed simply by forming simple metal wiring on the device."

    title: Gaze-Based Self-Confidence Estimation on Multiple-Choice Questions and Its Feedback
    abstract: "Self-confidence -- an assurance of one's personal decision and ability -- is one of the most important factors in learning. When there is a gap between a learner's confidence and comprehension, the learner loses a chance to review a learning subject correctly. To solve this problem, we propose a system which estimates self-confidence while solving multiple-choice questions by eye tracking and gives feedback about which question should be reviewed carefully. The system was evaluated in our experiment involving 20 participants. We observed that correct answer rates of questions were increased by 14% and 17% by giving feedback about correct answers without confidence and incorrect answers with confidence, respectively."

    title: Design of Alert App and related Device for Hearing Impaired Users in India and Afghanistan
    abstract: "Sounds are important pressure waves which keep us informed about the events around us. Most of these sounds such as the ringing of the phone, crying of a baby, doorbell, fire alarm, etc. are vital for us in the day to day life. People with hearing impairment have difficulties in recognition of these sounds. This paper discusses a paper prototype design of Alert Device and Smartphone Application for hearing impaired users. The prototype design of both Alert Device and Smartphone Applicaion is designed based on a detailed literature survey as well as peer Android application review. The prototype device design includes several important features such as detection of doorbell, crying of a baby, fire alarm, motion detection alarm, phone ringing, self-training of sound, SOS/Panic button, and sound log. This device provides alert information on the smartphone, tablet, and smartwatch. In the future, this alert information can also be provided on TV, lamps, flashing lights and other devices."

    title: "Kotha Bondhu: Translating Sign Languages into Bengali Voice"
    abstract: "Sign languages are the only communication medium for mute and deaf people all over the world, but all the general people are not familiar with it. It is really tough for these people to make other people understand their voices. In the context of Bangladesh, we have studied these community people specifically from the Tablighi Jamaat community who use different sign language to communicate with people. By studying them we have gathered the local signs along with global standard sign languages in an application named Kotha Bondhu. It is a very simpler application that is understandable to any community people and is able to translate the sign languages into Bengali voice."

    abstract: "Nowadays, a number of people with visual impairments (PVI) access public buses in the Seoul Metropolitan area. Existing studies reported the challenges faced by PVI when they use buses in multiple cities. Nevertheless, little is known about the accessibility issues of Seoul Metropolitan buses. To reduce the gap, we conducted semi-structured interviews with nine PVI to investigate the challenges and opportunities for accessible Seoul Metropolitan buses. We discovered ten challenges PVI faced when they use Seoul Metropolitan buses. Based on the identified challenges, we propose three opportunities for improving accessibility of the Seoul Metropolitan bus system."

    abstract: "This research aims to explore the elements of designing user interfaces that are affected by the cultural diversity of users through a pilot study focusing on Arab and western government sites. The issues of localization and globalization of websites and effects of cultural diversity in design of the user-interfaces have been around for a while, but most of the studies focused on western, American and Southeast Asian and represented their perspectives in general. This study intends to identify differences in design features between the government websites for each of (UK, French, Iraq, UAE), and analyses how these features are affected by cultural diversity. The outcomes of this research can contribute as guidelines within a framework that takes into consideration in the Arabic website development, especially towards the development of e-government websites."

    title: "Study of Instructional Illustrations on ICTs: Considering persona of low-literate users form India"
    abstract: "Technology has the potential to improve the lives of underprivileged communities from developing regions of the world, especially those with low-literacy skills. Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) researchers have conducted studies to understand an effective way to communicate with this group using Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs). Beyond facilitating communication, ICTs have transformed the way low-literate users send money, learn skills and seek references, etc. As instructions (guidelines, rules, laws or warnings) play an important part while using these services on ICTs, finding effective ways to deliver those instructions has become crucial for HCI practitioners, as low-literate users face difficulties in using ICTs with only textual interfaces [1]. This study focusses on communicating these instructions through visual communication in the form of instructional illustrations. The study further investigates the effectiveness of 'Instructional Illustrations' using an educational mobile app and compares it with traditional instructional video communication with the low-literate group of Anganwadi workers in India."

    title: "Design Thinking for Developing a Case-based Reasoning Emotion-Sensing Robot for Interactive Interview"
    abstract: "As the application of design and technology has become more interdisciplinary and integrated, the development of interactive service robots (ISRs), which are designed according to unique situational requirements, has emerged as a popular trend. Research has shown that if affective computing technologies and machine learning mechanisms can be introduced to enhance interaction and feedback between ISRs and users, ISRs may be better aligned with both the service scenarios and the future development of innovative services. Based on an interdisciplinary integration framework, this study combined the concept and methodologies  of design thinking, emotion detection technologies, and case-based reasoning (CBR), based on the  use case  of a simulated interview for empirical research, and developed a prototype emotion-sensing robot (ESR) system for the planning and testing of emotion sensing. Three emotion detection and analysis indicators, namely, happiness index of facial expressions, blink rate, and semantic emotions conveyed by the text on their resume, were proposed as the basis for analyzing emotional perception in this study. The experimental results were then used to analyze the effectiveness of the technologies as well as the value, utility, and affordance of the interactive interview bot  system."

    title: "BeActive: Encouraging Physical Activities with Just-in-time Health Intervention and Micro Financial Incentives"
    abstract: "Encouraging patients with cardiovascular disease to be more active is one of the critical challenges in conventional rehabilitation programs. Rehabilitation programs are mostly offered at specific times and locations (e.g., clinical facilities or in-home exercise programs), which are the root causes of participation barriers. We envision that use of mobile and wearable technologies can overcome such spatial/temporal restrictions and offer novel opportunities for promoting physical activities in their everyday lives.  In this position paper, we introduce BeActive, a mobile-based intervention platform that delivers just-in-time intervention messages to help patients to be more active in their daily lives. The key innovation of BeActive is to leverage fine-grained tracking of user behaviors to deliver just-in-time feedback and to incentivize health behavior maintenance via micro financial rewards. To show the feasibility of BeActive, we conducted a preliminary study for seven days (n=5), and presented several design improvements for just-in-time health intervention."

    title: Exercise Measurement using a Built-in Camera in a Mobile Device
    abstract: "Nowadays, as life expectancy increases, daily exercise have played a significant role for people to stay healthy. In this paper, we propose an exercise measurement system by a mobile device with a built-in camera. An application based on Unity for relevant exercise recording of a user is developed. In a proposed application platform, the system can measure and classify multiple kinds of exercise using only a video of a human face. It can save the troubles of a user during the experience, and the user’s motivation for exercise is likely to be improved. When a user exercises in a condition the face is put within an angle of view of a camera, the system utilizes 30 feature points with two dimensions from a video of the face. Fast Fourier transform is applied to extract the features from obtained frame data and classification of related exercises is performed by support vector machine (SVM). Via the Evaluation experiment, the average classification accuracy of our system can reach up to 91.5%."

    title: A case study of food production using Artificial intelligence
    abstract: "In these days, artificial intelligence (AI) finds applications in many different domains, including art creation such as painting and music. However, there is lack of know-how involving AI in developing food products. In this case, we analyzed a large number of Japanese newspaper articles and developed a chocolate that represents the mood of each year. Specifically, the mood was expressed by predicting the taste of words by machine learning. This paper describes how to create software that converts human sensation into taste, and how people develop products based on it, and how to evaluate the resulting product. In the result, we introduce a product developed with the support of artificial intelligence that has an effect of stimulating curiosity in consumers and can lead developers to new discoveries and perspectives. In the future, we aim to create a system that supports collaborative recipe development involving AI, developers, and consumers."

    title: Development of a Low Cost Wearable with Mobile Sensing to Monitor Driving Stress through HRV
    abstract: "Stress is a mental state that is responsible for changing human behavior. Driving stress is harmful because it may cause road accidents. In developing countries, the rate of road accidents is higher where driving stress is responsible very often. Today monitoring any stress by using wearable is a growing research area, but most of the commercially available wearables are expensive. Only a few wearables are developed to get specifically the driving stress in developed nations. We gradually develop a low-cost wearable associated with a mobile sensing application to detect the driving stress along with road conditions by analyzing HRV (Heart Rate Variability) in developing country context to support the low-income community."

    title: A Study of Wearable Accelerometers Layout for Human Activity Recognition
    abstract: "For  devices of human daily activity detection, accelerometer, can sense acceleration signals with different characteristics according to different parts of the human body. In this paper, we present a framework to investigate the impact of the number and placement of accelerometers on human daily activity recognition. 17 different parts of body are equipped with accelerometers, and examined. Multistage and multiswarm discrete particle swarm optimization (MSMS-DSPO) algorithm is developed to search the optimal sensor combinations on basis of number of sensor's demand. Additionally, user preferences of wearable sensor wearing is investigated and the motion recognition of involved place is analyzed as well. Thus, different sensor layouts for specific activity category recognition are provided, which is beneficial for user to arrange the devices on their body according to number requirement, activity type, preference or physical condition in an activity recognition application."

    title: Analyzing Bias of Comments on Political News Articles to Facilitate Transparent Online Communities
    abstract: "Comments on news articles can affect people's perceptions and behaviors. Especially, comments from political articles on the Internet can have a significant impact on potential elections. Nevertheless, little is known about how people determine the degree of bias (DoB) of comments on news articles. To address such bias issues, current platforms of news articles offer criteria to sort multiple comments on news articles. However, little is known about whether the DoB of comments is reduced when publishers offer various criteria for sorting comments. We conducted surveys to identify how people determine DoB of comments on news article, and how bias varies depending on how comments are sorted. As a result, there was a significant difference among the DoB by comments. Our final goal is to develop an algorithm that generates unbiased comments from existing comments of internet articles and DoB of them."

    abstract: "Open government data allows for transparency from governments and access to data collected about its citizens. However, we are still far from achieving universal citizen participation because data literacy and experience are necessary to extract insights from data. There is also no guarantee if available data can address people's information needs. We explored the potential of open government data portals in addressing the information needs of citizens through an online survey and found that these can only be partially answered by the available data. To understand their information seeking behavior, we conducted usability tests of open data portals with 21 citizens, and used semi-structured interviews to identify gaps in the portals' design. We found that citizens would benefit from: localized and advanced search engines; and visualized, contextualized, and processed content for better sensemaking. We conclude with design guidelines for open data portals catered to citizens."

    title: Writing Behavior as an Estimator of Self-Confidence on English Spelling Questions
    abstract: "Reviewing plays an important role in the learning process of humans. A user's self-confidence is as important as the correctness of the answer to distinguish what to review. Giving feedback based on self-confidence enables learners to improve the quality of the review. Since it is still a familiar way for many students to write by hand, we propose a self-confidence estimation method based on handwriting behavior. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, we employed the data collected while completing English spelling questions. The results revealed that the proposed method was able to predict self-confidence with 76% accuracy."

    title: A Smiley Face Icon Creator for Evaluating Emotion with Children
    abstract: "In order to design an interactive system for children, it is imperative to hear the opinions and emotions of children them- selves. However, it is challenging to investigate their emotions because of their limited abilities of expression. They are in development in literacy and communication skill. The smiley face Likert scale is a survey method that utilizes face icons to express children’s emotion regardless of their literacy. How- ever, the method typically uses five to seven face icons for a survey. The number of face icons in the survey restricts measuring children’s emotions in detail. This paper proposes a novel survey method that introduces the visual analog scale into the smiley face Likert scale. We developed a tool that al- lows children to change the styles of the eyebrows and mouth continuously. Our method allows investigators to understand their emotions in detail. Through our preliminary study, we confirmed that children could express emotion using our face icons to a similar extent to that of adults."

    title: "Are Two Heads Better than One? Exploring Two-Party Conversations for Car Navigation Voice Guidance"
    abstract: "Voice guidance for car navigation typically considers drivers as docile actors. Recent works highlight limitations to this assumption which make drivers rely less on given directions. To explore how drivers can make better navigation decisions, we conducted a pilot Wizard-of-Oz study that gives turn suggestions in conversations between two voice agents. We asked 30 participants to drive in a simulation environment using voice guidance that gives three types of suggestions: familiar, optimal, and new routes. We examined their route choices, perceived workload and utterances while driving. We found that while most drivers followed directions appropriate for the given scenarios, they were more likely to make inappropriate choices after hearing alternatives in conversations. On the other hand, two-party conversations allowed drivers to better reflect on their choices after trips. We conclude by discussing preliminary design implications for car navigation voice guidance specifically and recommender systems in general."

    title: "Crowdsourcing in China: Exploring the Work Experiences of Solo Crowdworkers and Crowdfarm Workers"
    abstract: "Recent research highlights the potential of crowdsourcing in China. Yet very few studies explore the workplace context and experiences of Chinese crowdworkers. Those that do, focus mainly on the work experiences of solo crowdworkers but do not deal with issues pertaining to the substantial amount of people working in ‘crowdfarms’. This article addresses this gap as one of its primary concerns. Drawing on a study that involves 48 participants, our research explores, compares and contrasts the work experiences of solo crowdworkers to those of crowdfarm workers. Our findings illustrate that the work experiences and context of the solo workers and crowdfarm workers are substantially different, with regards to their motivations, the ways they engage with crowdsourcing, the tasks they work on, and the crowdsourcing platforms they utilize.

    title: "FoodFab: Creating Food Perception Illusions using Food 3D Printing"
    abstract: "Food 3D printing enables the creation of customized food structures based on a person’s individual needs. In this paper, we explore the use of food 3D printing to create perceptual illusions for controlling the level of perceived satiety given a defined amount of calories. We present FoodFab, a system that allows users to control their food intake through modifying a food’s internal structure via two 3D printing parameters: infill pattern and infill density. In two experiments with a total of 30 participants, we studied the effect of these parameters on users’ chewing time that is known to affect people’s feeling of satiety. Our results show that we can indeed modify the chewing time by varying infill pattern and density, and thus control perceived satiety. Based on the results, we propose two computational models and integrate them into a user interface that simplifies the creation of personalized food structures."

    title: "The Government's Dividend: Complex Perceptions of Social Media Misinformation in China"
    abstract: "The social media environment in China has become the dominant source of information and news over the past decade. This news environment has naturally suffered from challenges related to mis- and dis-information, encumbered by an increasingly complex landscape of factors and players including social media services, fact-checkers, censorship policies, and astroturfing. Interviews with 44 Chinese WeChat users were conducted to understand how individuals perceive misinformation and how it impacts their news consumption practices. Overall, this work exposes the diverse attitudes and coping strategies that Chinese users employ in complex social media environments. Due to the complex nature of censorship in China and participants’ lack of understanding of censorship, they expressed varied opinions about its influence on the credibility of online information sources. Further, although most participants claimed that their opinions would not be easily swayed by astroturfers, many admitted that they could not effectively distinguish astroturfers from ordinary Internet users. Participants’ inability to make sense of comments found online lead many participants to hold pro-censorship attitudes: the Government’s Dividend."

    title: "Designing Grit: Discovering Features Towards Supporting Novice Programmer DevOps Integration"
    abstract: "DevOps is usually an industry approach that is practiced by seasoned and experienced programmers and developers.  In most university settings especially in the Philippine context, DevOps is not usually part of the curriculum and in some cases are only introduced to learner programmers as an elective or as bonus material. We refer to these learners as novice program-mers as defined by [5].  Upon graduation, these developers transition into industry roles where they are expected to be familiar with DevOps practices [10]. In most cases, they are not prepared, and fortunately, a great number of them are given training before fully transitioning into their hired roles.  In this paper, we attempt to discover and design an intervention mechanism that can assist and prepare novice programmers to easily learn DevOps at an early stage.  We gathered data and insights from novice programmers and inquired into their pains and struggles in learning and practicing DevOps.  To help them in this process, we propose Grit, a prototype tool to support novice programmers in integrating DevOps. Features and insights provided affordances and coming up with a set of guidelines that cater to the needs of novice programmers."

    title: Development of real-world sensor optimal placement support software
    abstract: "There have been many studies on gesture recognition and posture estimation by combining real-world sensors and machine learning. In such situations, it is important to consider the sensor layout because the measurement result varies depending on the layout, number of sensors, and motion to be measured. However, it takes time and effort to prototype devices multiple times to find a sensor layout that has high identification accuracy. In this study, we developed software that can simulate the optimal layout and number of real-world sensors. In this time, the software can treat distance-measuring sensors as real-world sensors, and the user places these sensors freely in the software. The software measures the distance between the sensors and a mesh created from measurements of real-world deformation recorded by a Kinect device. We identified facial expressions using the distance data acquired by using the software. We simulated the optimal sensor placement for each number of sensors by increasing the number of sensors used for identification one by one in the software."

    title: Video Lifelog Retrieval System for Ambiguous Search Queries
    abstract: "The fifth-generation mobile network (5G) will soon become popular, and data utilization will increase. Although there is a large volume of video data, making it difficult to manage and use such data in our daily lives, there is huge potential with such data. We now often take photos using smartphones, but in future recording our lives by wearing video cameras would become popular. Since such data have a large amount of information, a video lifelog retrieval system is necessary. Although many studies on video retrieval have been conducted on some domains, e.g. TV programs, movies and so on, there have been few conducted on lifelogs. One of the main differences between them is regarding user queries and the fact that our memories are often ambiguous. We propose a video lifelog retrieval system that takes advantage of ambiguous search queries. We discuss the effectiveness of our system from our evaluation involving our own lifelog data we collected. We also discuss the characteristics of lifelog data and problems of our system."

    title: Leveraging Error Correction in Voice-based Text Entry by Talk-and-Gaze
    abstract: "We present the design and evaluation of Talk-and-Gaze (TaG), a method for selecting and correcting errors with voice and gaze. TaG uses eye gaze to overcome the inability of voice-only systems to provide spatial information. The user’s point of gaze is used to select an erroneous word either by dwelling on the word for 800 ms (D-TaG) or by uttering a “select” voice command (V-TaG). A user study with 12 participants compared D-TaG, V-TaG, and a voice-only method for selecting and correcting words. Corrections were performed more than 20% faster with D-TaG compared to the V-TaG or voice-only methods. As well, D-TaG was observed to require 24% less selection effort than V-TaG and 11% less selection effort than voice-only error correction. D-TaG was well received in a subjective assessment with 66% of users choosing it as their preferred choice for error correction in voice-based text entry."
