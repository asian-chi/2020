    <p class="abstract-overview">
        The Asian CHI Symposium invites latest HCI research papers <em>from Asia</em> and those focusing on <em>incorporating Asian sociocultural factors in their design and implementation</em>. Showcasing works from Asian countries and those closely related to the Asian culture and society, the symposium promotes the region's unique problems and approaches to the global community. It also intends to foster a network of young researchers like masters students, and more specifically, senior doctoral candidates and those who recently graduated. We encourage the participation of researchers and practitioners from Asian communities in all career stages (e.g., seasoned academics, early career researchers, graduate students, and even undergraduates who have strong interests in HCI).
    </p>
    <h2>Themes</h2>
    <div class="abstract-overview">
        <p>
            We invite submissions on any of the following research themes and/or contributions:

            <li>Novel interactive systems and interaction techniques;</li>
            <li>Novel hardware and software enabling new forms of interaction with computers;</li>
            <li>Studies for understanding human capabilities related to interaction with computers;</li>
            <li>Theories that explain human behaviors around computer systems;</li>

    </div>
    <h2>Submission Types</h2>
    <div class="abstract-overview">
        <p>
            This year, we welcome two (2) types of submissions.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="about-highlight" id="original-works">Original works</span> are either (1) complete, (2) present preliminary results, or (3) present an extension or a discussion of an alternative perspective of previously published work. Submissions must be in a maximum of six (6) pages in the <a href="https://chi2020.acm.org/authors/chi-proceedings-format/" target="_blank">CHI 2020 Extended Abstract format</a>.  
        </p>
        <p>
            Original works that are accepted to present at the symposium may choose to have their camera-ready submissions to be listed in the ACM Digital Library as (1) the whole 6-page extended abstract, (2) only the abstract paragraph/s, or (3) not at all. For those who will choose (3), their title and list of authors will be included in the front matter of the proceedings. These options provide enough flexibility for work-in-progress submissions so that they can continue their work and have it published later in a journal or conference. For authors who will choose to publish their whole extended abstracts, there will be a <em>shepherding</em> post-symposium: Selected mentors will closely work with authors to improve the quality of the manuscript. Only submissions that successfully go through the shepherding will be added to the ACM Digital Library.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="about-highlight" id="showcase-works">Showcase</span> are works that will be presented at other CHI 2020 tracks. They could be presented at the symposium to broaden the dissemination of high quality published research and to inspire applications, replications, continuation, spin-offs and collaboration. For <em>showcase</em> submissions, authors should submit the pre-print camera-ready version of their accepted submission to CHI 2020 (any track). There is no need to change to the Extended Abstract template.
        </p>
        <p>
            For showcase submissions, their entry in the proceedings of the symposium will contain only the abstract with a pointer to the corresponding entry in the CHI 2020 Proceedings or Extended Abstract Proceedings.
        </p>
        <p>
            All submissions should include key references to publicly-accessible resources. Both types of submissions should not be anonymized and must be uploaded through PCS 2.0 <em>(link to follow)</em>. 
        </p>
    </div>
    <h2>Paper Review & Selection</h2>
    <div class="abstract-overview">
        <p>
            Each <em>original</em> submission will receive two anonymized reviews under the following criteria: originality; significance; and validity. Detailed feedback from reviewers will be given to those who will choose to publish 6-page extended abstracts. Light feedback will only be given to authors who will choose the other 2 publication options.
        </p>
        <p>
            The submissions under the <em>showcase</em> category will be curated by taking into account the following factors: the number of the accepted original submissions; the geographical diversity of the attendees; and the diversity of research topics.
        </p>
    </div>
    <h2>At the Symposium</h2>
    <div class="abstract-overview">
        <p>
            At least one author of each accepted submission must attend the symposium to present their work. All participants must register for the symposium and at least one day of the conference.
        </p>
        <p>
            At the symposium, accepted submissions must bring posters summarizing their work. They may also bring other equipment should they choose to demo their work.
        </p>
