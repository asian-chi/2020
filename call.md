    <p class="abstract-overview">
        The Asian CHI Symposium invites latest HCI research papers <em>from Asia</em> and those focusing on <em>incorporating Asian sociocultural factors in their design and implementation</em>. Showcasing works from Asian countries and those closely related to the Asian culture and society, the symposium promotes the region's unique problems and approaches to the global community. It also intends to foster a network of young researchers like masters students, and more specifically, senior doctoral candidates and those who recently graduated. We encourage the participation of researchers and practitioners from Asian communities in all career stages (e.g., seasoned academics, early career researchers, graduate students, and even undergraduates who have strong interests in HCI).

    </div>
    <h2>Submission Types</h2>
    <div class="abstract-overview">
        <p>
            This year, we welcome two (2) types of submissions.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="about-highlight" id="original-works">Original works</span> either 
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>present completed systems and studies,</li>
            <li>present preliminary results of early iterations of design, engineering, or empirical studies, or</li>
            <li>present an extension or a discussion of an alternative perspectives of previously-published work.</li>
        </ol>
        <div class="with-figure">
            <p>
                Submissions must be in a maximum of four (4) pages in the <a href="https://chi2020.acm.org/authors/chi-proceedings-format/" target="_blank">CHI 2020 Papers Proceeding template</a>. Acknowledgement and references are included in this page limit. The submission language is English. Failing to comply with the template may result in a desk rejection.
            </p>
            <div class="template-icon"></div>
        </div>
        <p>
            Original works that are accepted to present at the symposium may choose to have their camera-ready submissions to be listed in the ACM Digital Library one of the following formats:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>the whole 4-page submission,</li>
            <li>only the abstract paragraph/s, or</li>
            <li>not at all.</li> 
        </ol>
        <p>
            For those who will choose (2) or (3), their title and list of authors will be included in the front matter of the proceedings. These options provide enough flexibility for work-in-progress submissions so that they can continue their work and have it published later in a journal or conference.
        </p>
        <p>    
            For authors who will choose to publish their submissions but require major revisions, there will be <em>shepherding</em>. Selected mentors will work closely with authors to improve the quality of the manuscript at and after the symposium. Only shepherded submissions that successfully go through the shepherding process with approval of the mentor-shepherd within the set deadline will be added to the ACM Digital Library. Submissions that require minor or no revisions will be added to the ACM Digital Library proceedings after the camera-ready deadline and confirmation from the Reviewing chairs.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="about-highlight" id="showcase-works">Showcase</span> are works that will be presented at other CHI 2020 tracks (as listed <a href="https://chi2020.acm.org/authors/" target="_blank">here</a>). They could be presented at the symposium to broaden the dissemination of high quality published research and to inspire applications, replications, continuation, spin-offs and collaboration. For <em>showcase</em> submissions, authors should submit the pre-print camera-ready version of their accepted submission to CHI 2020 (any track). There is no need to change to the symposium's template.
        </p>
        <p>
            For showcase submissions, their entry in the front matter of the proceedings of the symposium will contain only the title and author names with a pointer to the corresponding entry in the CHI 2020 Proceedings or Extended Abstract Proceedings.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="about-highlight">Both the original and showcase</span> submissions should include key references to publicly accessible resources. Both types of submissions should not be anonymized and must be uploaded through <a href="https://asianchi20.hotcrp.com/" target="_blank">HotCRP</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Authors may also submit a draft of their poster as supplementary material. They may start following the symposiumâ€™s <a href="../poster-guide/" target="_blank">poster guidelines</a>.
        </p>
    </div>
    <h2>Selection Process</h2>
    <div class="abstract-overview">
        <p>
            Each <span class="about-highlight"><em>original</em></span> submission will go through a <a href="https://chi2020.acm.org/authors/selection-processes/" target="_blank">juried</a> process and receive two anonymized reviews under the following criteria: originality; significance; and validity. Detailed feedback from reviewers will be given to those who will choose to publish their 4-page articles. Light feedback will be given to authors who will choose the other 2 publication options.
        </p>
        <p>
            The submissions under the <span class="about-highlight"><em>showcase</em></span> category will be <a href="https://chi2020.acm.org/authors/selection-processes/" target="_blank">curated</a> by taking into account the following factors: the number of the accepted original submissions; the geographical diversity of the attendees; and the diversity of research topics. The decision will be sent to the authors without reviews or light feedback.
        </p>
    </div>
    <h2>At the Symposium</h2>
    <div class="abstract-overview">
        <p>
            At least one author of each accepted submission must attend the symposium to present their work. All participants must register for the symposium and at least one day of the conference.
