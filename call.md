    <p class="abstract-overview">
        The Asian CHI Symposium invites latest HCI research papers <em>from Asia</em> and those focusing on <em>incorporating Asian sociocultural factors in their design and implementation</em>. This symposium aims to showcase works originated from each Asian country or closely related to the Asian culture and society, and promote its unique problems and approaches to the global community. We encourage the participation of researchers and practitioners from Asian communities in all career stages (e.g., seasoned academics, early career researchers, graduate students, and even undergraduates who have strong interests in HCI). This symposium is also intended to foster a network of young researchers like masters students, and more specifically, senior doctoral candidates and those who recently graduated. We encourage the participation of researchers and practitioners from Asian communities in all career stages (e.g., seasoned academics, early career researchers, graduate students, and even undergraduates who have strong interests in HCI)

    <h2>Submission</h2>
    <div class="abstract-overview">
        <p>
            This year, we welcome two (2) types of submissions.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="about-highlight">Original works</span> are either (1) complete, (2) present preliminary results, or (3) present an extension or a discussion of an alternative perspective of previously published work. Submissions must be maximum six pages in <a href="https://chi2020.acm.org/authors/chi-proceedings-format/" target="_blank">CHI 2020 Extended Abstract format</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="about-highlight">Showcase</span> are works that will be presented at other CHI 2020 tracks. They could be presented at the symposium to broaden the dissemination of high quality published research and to inspire applications, replications, continuation, spin-offs and collaboration.
        </p>
        <p>All types of submissions are not anonymized and must be uploaded through PCS 2.0 <em>(link to follow)</em>.</p>
    </div>
    <h2>Themes</h2>
    <div class="abstract-overview">
        <p>
            Submissions can be on any of the following research themes and/or contributions:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Novel interactive systems and interaction techniques;</li>
            <li>Novel hardware and software enabling new forms of interaction with computers;</li>
            <li>Studies for understanding human capabilities related to interaction with computers;</li>
            <li>Theories that explain human behaviors around computer systems;</li>
            <li>Systems and services that address issues prominent in Asia; and</li>
            <li>Input and output systems to support creative activities and expressions.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <h2>Template & Number of Pages</h2>
    <p class="abstract-overview">
        Submissions must be in a maximum of six (6) pages in the <a href="https://chi2020.acm.org/authors/chi-proceedings-format/" target="_blank">CHI 2020 Extended Abstract format</a>. All submissions should include key references to publicly-accessible resources. Accompanying videos are highly encouraged. The submission is unanonymized. The names and affiliation of the authors must be shown. For the <em>showcase</em> submissions only the pre-print camera-ready version of the original submission to CHI 2020 is needed. (No need to change to the Extended Abstract template.)
    </p>
    <h2>Paper Review & Selection</h2>
    <p class="abstract-overview">
        Each original submission will receive two anonymized reviews under the following criteria: originality; significance; and validity. The submissions under the showcase category will be curated by taking into account the following factors: the number of the accepted original submissions; the geographical diversity of the attendees; and the diversity of research topics.
    </p>
    <h2>Conference Registration</h2>
    <p class="abstract-overview">
        At least one author of each accepted submission must attend the symposium to present their work. All participants must register for the symposium and at least one day of the conference.
    </p>
    <h2>Publication</h2>
    <div class="abstract-overview">
    <p>
        Original submissions that are accepted to present at the symposium may choose to have their camera-ready submissions to be listed in the ACM Digital Library as abstract-only, the whole extended abstract, or not at all. These options provide enough flexibility for work-in-progress submissions so that they can continue their work and have it published later in a journal or conference. For authors who will choose to publish their whole extended abstracts, thereâ€™s a shepherding post-symposium: Selected mentors will closely work with authors to improve the quality of the manuscript. Only submissions that successfully go through the shepherding will be added to the ACM Digital Library.
    </p>
    <p>
        For the showcase submissions, their entry in the proceedings of the symposium will contain only the abstract with a pointer to the corresponding entry in the CHI 2020 Proceedings or Extended Abstract Proceedings.
